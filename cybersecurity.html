										<h2 id="content"></h2>
										<p>Cybersecurity is the use of practices, programs and technology to keep IT systems safe from invasion, targeted malfunction, intellectual property theft and malicious Cyber-attacks. There are many ways Cybersecurity experts achieve these goals today some of these are;</p>
										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Firewalls</h3>
												<p>A firewall is a network security system that monitors all IT traffic coming in and out of the system, it is set up to protect using predetermined security methods[1]. A fire wall can be thought of as the customs officers we see on every countries border, sifting through the people and contents crossing the border and protecting against attacks of all kinds.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Encrypt and back up data</h3>
												<p>Encrypting data is translating data into code so it cannot be read or used, the data is then retrieved with a decryption key[2], this could be very useful against intellectual property theft attacks and ransomware attacks where information and/or data is stolen and either used or sold back to the owner at a ransom. Backing up data is also used to ensure an organisations or businesses information and data still exists after an attack.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Security awareness practices</h3>
												<p>Good security awareness practices range from employee education, employee screenings, updating software regularly, developing Cyber breach plans, company's limiting access to their most valuable data and knowing exactly where your data goes and who’s hands is it in and much more.</p>

												<h2>The Future of Cybersecurity</h2>
											</header>
												<p>As it stands today cyber threats are growing more and more common as we edge towards a world enriched in technology, we have become dependent on our devices for almost everything making Cyber-attacks a very real and sobering reality. How will we be combating this threat in the future? One way is through the use of artificial intelligence (AI), Chuck Brooks, a world leader in Cybersecurity and emerging technologies describes AI in Cybersecurity as , “technology that appears to emulate human performance typically by learning, coming to its own conclusions, appearing to understand complex content, engaging in natural dialogues with people, enhancing human cognitive performance or replacing people on execution of non-routine tasks”[3]. So what does this mean? It means computers will likely one day soon be sentient and will have cognitive autonomy, they will possess the ability to analyse, learn, detect and mitigate any upcoming suspected Cyber-attacks. </p>
												<p>One technology helping drive the rise of AI is quantum computing, what is this new form of computing? Quantum computers use a new mode of computing based on ‘qubits’, instead of regular bits. Qubits are more workable than bits because they can be turned on, off or in a state of ‘superposed’ which is basically a state of limbo[4], think of Schrödinger’s Cat neither dead or alive. What does this mean? I have no idea and you would be forgiven to not understand as well, this is quantum mechanics after all. So how does AI, quantum computing and Cybersecurity tie together? With the use of these supercomputers we can advance AI to unimaginable heights creating methods and solving many problems we face today in all aspects of life let alone Cybersecurity. An example of the incredible power quantum computing will provide was seen back in October of 2019, researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbra used 53 entangled qubits to solve a problem with a quantum computer in just 200 seconds, this same problem would have taken a supercomputer 10,000 years to solve[4]. Having this incredible computing power will help AI learn and adapt faster than humans and regular computers can, there is of course one possess to this and that is if this technology gets into the wrong hands. Modern-day encryption practices will be made redundant if these computers can decipher codes in minutes or perhaps instantly instead of years, luckily there might be some ways around this using quantum key distribution (QKD), this uses quantum physics to build an encryption key[4].</p>
												<p>The potential impact of AI in Cybersecurity will hopefully mitigate or at least damper the frequency and cost of Cyber-attacks, in Australia last year Cyber-attacks cost the country roughly AUD$29 billion[5], the rough cost of Cyber crime worldwide was estimated to be a staggering AUD$839 billion back in 2018[6]. Ransomware attacks are now also on the rise with Australian businesses forking out on average AUD$36,295 each attack[5]. AI-powered by quantum computing can detect malicious malware and irregular behaviour on its network, it can then deactivate and ‘quarantine’ a device to stop the spread of the attack[7]. These attacks can also spread through email links and can again be stopped by the AI before spreading by blocking downloads and disconnecting infected devices[7].</p>
												<p>Drawbacks of AI in Cybersecurity comes from again whether or not this technology falls into the wrong hands or is used in a malicious way, it is possible for a hacker to use AI and its machine learning capabilities to test new software and methods used in Cyber-attacks, this could be particularly damaging because this new attack will be AI-proof[8]. “The more contact I have with humans, the more I learn”-The Terminator, jokes aside an attack so large and complex even a quantum-enhanced AI system can struggle with sounds like a recipe for disaster, so will AI’s be weaponized then? Yes. It is already happening and has been for some years now by hackers and, much more alarmingly countries and their military's. The U.S.A, China and Russia have all entered a race to develop the world's most powerful AI, with Russian President Vladimir Putin stating that the leader in AI will rule the world[9] while China's Xi Jinping stated back in 2017 that AI will be the global military competition in the future, he also said China will be the world leader in AI development by the year 2030[9] and finally, American President Donald Trump signed an executive order back in 2018 called “Executive order on maintaining American leadership in AI”[9], these three examples all highlight the desire to develop and weaponize AI by the three leaders.</p>
												<p>What kind of impact will weaponized AI have in the world? And can Cybersecurity keep up? unfortunately for everyone the technology that is being developed to combat Cybersecurity is moving at a slower pace than the technology to perform Cyber-attacks is[10], and if that is not bad enough the technology readily available to someone wishing to perform Cyber-attacks has risen too[10]. But doom and gloom aside let's focus on what AI in Cybersecurity will be able to do or is doing to aid us in defending against Cyber-attacks, currently there is a large number of Cybersecurity jobs available worldwide, sounds great? Not exactly, there are 2.8 million employed in Cybersecurity as of November 2019 in Australia, U.S.A, Mexico, Canada, U.K, Germany, France, Singapore, Brazil, Japan and South Korea but the number of qualified individuals it will take to fill the empty jobs is another 4 million[11]. This is where AI can come of use, some company's around the world receive more than 1 million security alerts per day[12], these alerts cannot be ignored and must be attended to it is not knows how severe they are or can be until checked. An AI system can sift through the alerts and bring the most important ones to the top furthermore AI solutions can detect things humans might otherwise miss[12]. These two solutions combined will help improve data security by freeing up Cybersecurity workers and allowing them to prioritise on the highest threats. </p>
												<p>In summary, we have become reliant on technology and with that comes ways to exploit it for material, digital or political gain, AI with its machine learning capabilities bolstered by the incredible computing power of quantum computing can one day be a solution to most of the problems faced today in Cybersecurity but unfortunately like all new technologies can and may one day be used as a tool to exploit it. The only silver lining I can see personally after researching about this topic is if we can use AI to fill the roles that are desperately need in the Cybersecurity field.</p>
