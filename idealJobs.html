								<h3>Ideal Job In IT</h3>
								<p>My ideal job is something along the lines of a <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50772136?type=standard#searchRequestToken=c4c07296-b816-42d8-bd3c-247d74c69e4b" target="_blank">Cyber Security Analyst.</a></p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/hamiltonsIdealJob.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								</div>
								<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
								<p>For now, my goal is to be working in the Cybersecurity filed in the future which will require further study that I am willing to undertake. I have chosen this role not only out of interest but out of the fact the job is in demand.</p>
								<p>A Cyber security analyst has the role of monitoring and keeping secure a company's or organisations network and services. There main roles are to monitor security, prevent breaches using various software and tactics and to act quickly to resolve any breaches or data theft that may occur. The demand for Cyber security analysts is growing just as fast as our innovation and development of new technology is, because of this Cyber security analysts need to be innovative and good problem solvers, the ever changing landscape of I.T is constantly providing new problems and challenges that must be addressed quickly and creatively.</p>
								<p>Although I wont learn everything I will require to fill this role studying the current course I am, I believe it will at least provide a path that will lead to further study and set a solid foundation for myself to build upon.</p>

									<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
									<p>I believe at this point in time, I would like to be a 'Front End Web Developer', but specifically focused within the marketing industry.</p>
									<p>Dilate Digital is a digital marketing agency, which focuses on implementing digital business marketing strategies to enable clients to reach their targeted audience effectively. They effectively work on four fundamental principles discover, build, launch and grow. They
										are looking for someone to implement and build highly functional and clean websites that are fundamentally SEO (Search Engine Optimised). This allows the business to show as the top results in search engines such a Google, Bing and Yahoo through the use of using keywords.</p>

										<h2>Adam's - Ideal Job</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Ideal Job In IT</h3>
									<p>Currently, my ideal job is as a <a href="https://www.portable.com.au/">Lead Software Developer</a> working on social projects that assist everyday individuals.</p>
									<div class= "row">
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<span class="image main"><img src="images/adamIdealJob.fw.png" alt="adam Ideal Job"/></span>

										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<p>The position which I would love to apply for is from a company called Portable. They work to create a positive impact on people
											in areas of mental health, education, access to justice and death & ageing in collaboration with organisations like Headspace.
											The role requires the lead software developer to manage and execute large development projects, deliver high-quality technical work,
											and to mentor & manage other team members in projects. The position requires skills which I believe I have strong foundations for
											like complex problem solving, analysis and team mentoring & skills as well as some skills which I will need to improve upon such as
											leadership and project management. Qualifications most likely are a degree in IT, Software Engineering/Development and perhaps Project Planning/Management.</p>
											<p>I believe my studies at RMIT and future Bachelors of IT degree are steps in the correct direction in working towards the goal
											of my ideal job. It will provide me with great foundational knowledge, experience, and qualifications for further studies which will lead me to my end goal.</p>

										<h2>Jeremy's - Ideal Job</h2>

									<h3>Ideal Job In IT</h3>
									<p>My ideal job would be a service technician of some sort. </p>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<span class="image main"><img src="images/Mid-level Service Desk Technician.jpg" alt="jeremy ideal job"/></span>
										</div>
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<p>This job is appealing for me because it involves helping people with problems that may arise. I work in an office services role at the moment and one day would want to move into an IT support role.</p>
											<p>This job involves working from remote areas away from customers and rarely onsite as well. Helping with servers and desktops. Having knowledge of cloud-based infrastructure. Need to be highly knowledgeable and experienced with solutions to maintain best practice environments.</p>
											<p>The skills I have at the moment are the basic skills. I am a fast learner that is always ready to help in any situation. Iâ€™m a willing participant in activities and tasks. I am a responsible and respectful worker that tries my absolute best at everything I do.</p>
											<p>The way that I will obtain the skills needed to apply for this job would be to learn effectively. I am willing to put in the hard work to achieve good grades for courses I enrol in at RMIT and am looking forward to enjoying each course up until I have the necessary skills to apply for a job like the one above. </p>

						<h2>Group Discussion of Jobs Comparison</h2>
							<p>It is interesting to compare all the different skill sets required by the different fields of IT Specialists. Some of the Ideal Jobs are required to learn advanced programming languages such as Java, C++, Python and Scala. These skills-sets require further self-development to keep up with industry standards. Cybersecurity, however, requires developing advanced analytical skills and may require knowledge of security across various platforms. Front End Web Developers and Service Technicians both may be required to learn Html. Front End Web Developers may require business and marketing skills. More advanced programming skills are required in all the compared jobs besides the Service Desk Technician.</p>  

							<p>Our specific ideal jobs tended to all focus on a specific field. For the Web Developers, Jacopo has more interest and focus on the creative side of it, and Nicholas on the marketing side. Jeremyâ€™s ideal job fits into technical support work. Adamâ€™s focuses on Software Development for social work. Lastly, Hamiltonâ€™s ideal job surrounds security and defence. </p>

							<p>However, all these different Ideal Jobs are required to have good communications skills, problem-solving skills and are required to develop teamwork skills within a team. </p>
