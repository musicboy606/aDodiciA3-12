												<h3>About Me</h3>
												<p>I live in Victoria, Australia, I have mostly worked in corporate Aviation but for the last few years have worked in a family business Dromkeen, which is the home of Australian childrenâ€™s literature and illustration.
													Dromkeen has an annual literature festival and hosts a variety of small and major events as well as exhibitions, all of which I have been directly involved in; from website content management, to audio-visual setup, logistics management, as well as exhibition installation, I am a "Jack of all trades".
													I am currently a student enrolled in 'Introduction to Information Technology' and 'Introduction to Programming' through Open Universities Australia, studying at RMIT. Through my studies at RMIT I hope to pursue
													 opportunities within the IT industry.

													</p>

													<h3>Interests In IT</h3>
													<p>From an early age, I have always been fascinated with different forms of Technology. I have enjoyed building and maintaining computers, deconstructing and fixing various laptops and mobile phone devices
													around the house. I try to keep informed about the various technological innovations and leading news from around the world. I also have an interest in how different devices seamlessly interact with each other. I also
													look after the 'Dromkeen' website(using wordpress) and social media content. Information Technology is like aviation from the aspect that there's a lot of problem-solving involved and that you have to
													troubleshot and understood how a particular system works, to enable you to find a solution.</p>

												<h3>Ideal Job In IT</h3>
												<p>At this point in time, I believe I would like to be a 'Front End Web Developer'; someone who designs and implements visual elements and how a user should interact within a website. When designing this website the
													'Front End Web Developer' also needs to understand SEO(Search Engine Opimisation), to generate website traffic through the use of search engines, such as Google, Bing and Yahoo. However, as I progress my through my studies
													at RMIT, my 'ideal job' may change. I will ensure not to close any doors and keep an open mind when searching for my ideal job during the course. </p>
											</div>
												<div>
													<h3>Personality Profile</h3>
													<p>I have taken three different personality tests to outline my personal profile. </p>
													<p>The three personality tests I have taken are the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/" target="_blank">Myer Briggs</a>, <a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/" target="_blank">Big 5 Personality</a>
													 , and the <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml" target="_blank">Learning Style</a> tests.</p>
													 <img src="images/nicholasTest.PNG" />
													 <h3>Test results</h3>
													 <p>After taking these three tests, I have specifically identified some characteristics that allign with my own. In the Myer Briggs personality test, it includes good practical skills, loyal, hard working, enthusiastic and
														 supportive. Although, it does mention that in times I might have a tendency to take on too much responsibility, instead of seeking out additional help I try to do things on my own. When learning to co-operate within a
														 group I will need to be able to learn when it is appropriate to seek out further help to complete a task.</p>
