									<h2 id="content">Overview</h2>
									<p>Over the course of the past year, a substantial portion of the population has found themselves decimated mentally, physically and financially due to the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Focusing on mental health, In-touch plans to provide a platform to motivate and enable individuals to begin the journey in confronting their issues and take steps to recovery, self-improvement, and healthiness.  In-touch plans to do this through a couple of main features which aim to present users with healthy suggestions, a sense of community, and references to professional services.</p>
									<div class="row">
										<div>
											<h3>Topic</h3>
											<p>According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics report for 2007, <i>“Of the 16 million Australians aged 16-85 years, almost half (45% or 7.3 million) had a lifetime mental disorder, i.e. a mental disorder at some point in their life.”</i>[1] In combination with a survey of 5000 people by John Mackay from September 2020, 78% of participants said their mental health had declined, citing feelings of uncertainty, loneliness and financial worries with rates of depression, stress and anxiety increasing[2]. The reach which In-touch could potentially have is quite large based off of this data. In-touch aims to provide its assistance in an easily accessible, understandable and convenient way, bringing suggestions in-line with reliable sources such as the World Health Organisation alike the “Messages for people in isolation” section of their 2020 mental health report, optimising themes such as “Stay connected and maintain your social networks,” “Engage in healthy activities” and “Exercise regularly”[3] for a mobile application. </p>
										</div>
										<div>
											<h3>Motivation</h3>
											<p>IN-touch is a mental health mobile app designed to provide users with an online platform for coping with loneliness and isolation inspired by the recent events related to COVID-19 restrictions. It is based on two main functions: the online community feature and the motivational feature. </p>

											<h3>Tools & Tech Required for Development</h3>
											<p>The program we are using to develop In-touch will be <a href="https://reactnative.dev/" >React Native.</a> React Native was developed by Facebook Inc. In 2015 and is used by many companies including Facebook, Instagram, Discord and Skype. It is an open-source application framework development tool used to create applications on Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS, Web, Windows and UWP[1]. When deciding on how we wanted to build In-touch we had to decide on what type of application we wanted to develop, being either a web, native or a hybrid application, there are pros and cons to all, but in the end a hybrid application seemed to be the best choice.</p>

											<p>The deciding factors for us were; no browser is needed to run the application (a necessity for web applications),  efficiency, allowing us to create applications for both android and iOS using Java for Android or Objective-C and Swift for iOS by writing out code once and hybrid applications also have access to the devices internal API’s meaning it can access features we need like the camera for video calls[2]. It also has a very large user base meaning there are plenty of tutorials and content to help us learn how to use it, one website we are all familiar with is W3schools.</p>
											<p>As for the back-end of our application, we will be using <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" >Firebase website</a>. The reason we have chosen this is for simplicity reasons, using a service like Firebase means we can focus on front end development while taking advantage of free server space (at least for development while there is minimal storage required) and not having to deal with any back end development. Firebase also offers cloud storage and cloud functions allowing the sharing of user-generated content like images, audio and visual, as well as a real-time database allowing the In-touch application to synchronise states across clients in real-time and also offers authentication allowing the users to sign in with Google accounts[4].</p>
											<p>In summary for us to create this application we will need to have installed React Native, Firebase and an integrated development environment (IDE) like eclipse. We will then need to create a new project on React Native and Firebase (we will need a Google account to do so), after doing this we then need to merge the project and may need to install some relevant Firebase dependencies.</p>
											<p></p>

											<h3>Skills Required for Development</h3>
												<p>Creating an app needs a competent and creative team that can work together effectively. There are many skills that are needed to take on this type of project. Mobile app development is a tough space and there are many skills that you need in your team before you take on the challenge.

											<p><ol><li>Project management is needed for major liaising between the project team and client. They dig into the business and communicate that through to the team.</li>
											<li>Business analysis is a skill that takes the vision that the client has set forth and mapping them toward development needs for the project team.</li>
											<li>User interface and user experience are very important as it is the creation of how the app looks and feels.</li>
											<li>Design refers to the overall feel of the app. Clients would not want an ugly app and app icons. Customers want an app that looks appealing that provides a good experience and brings value.</li>
											<li>Writing is a very important part of an app. The writing needs to be persuasive and include professional quality writing.</li>
											<li>Communication is key with any team that works together. It’s important to have clear communication and have both speech and writing.</li>
											<li>Performance testing is a crucial part for the ongoing viability of any app. There should be a strict development team that have strict methods in place for performance testing.</li></p>
											<p>The remainder of skills are the ones that software engineers should bring to the team:</p>
											<p><li>Modern coding languages such as HTML5, Java, C++, Objective-C, Swift, and C#. Not all of them need to be used of course, but they should be skills in one or more of them.</li>
											<li>Cloud infrastructure is a very important part of app development and many other types of development. The team should be skilled in Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services to deploy and manage applications and services.</li>
											<li>Cross-platform capabilities are an important aspect of developing an app. You might start your app on Android, iOS, or Windows, but any successful app will eventually work on all platforms.</li>
											<li>Data expertise is needed with apps that collect data and recognise results. Data engineers create efficient databases and repositories to create a smoother and better performing app.</li>
											<li>Integration with cloud-hosted systems like Amazon web services has grown large and versatile. The app might want to push data into these systems to draw data out.</li>
											<li>Security is definitely an important part of any tech development company. There will always be some risk and minimising the risk is important. You can never be too safe online.</li></p>
											</ol>

											<h3>Outcome</h3>
											<p>With the success of In-touch, individuals who have struggled with mental hardships during the COVID-19 pandemic will take the application’s guided steps to manage and resolve their mental health problems as well as re-connecting to others through the social interaction the application provides. In-touch also aims to extend past the COVID-19 issue, pushing its reach to individuals in ways that may not seem apparent at first. It may not be able to remedy the mental health issues that all Australians have faced, however, the hope is in that it will provide a system for a majority of these individuals to improve upon their mental health or lead them to professionals who can help. In-touch would impact the lives & health of plentiful Australians, pushing the mental health issues further into the spotlight and even become a source of community. </p>
