										<h3>What is Blockchain?</h3>
										<p>Invented in 2008 by a pseudonymous person, or group of people, known as Satoshi Nakamoto, the blockchain is commonly referred to as a public distributed ledger technology (DLT). To put it simply, it is a protocol relying on peer-to-peer (P2P) electronic cash system using cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin), in which transactions are recorded on immutable, encrypted blocks of data existing and managed by multiple computers across the network.</p>
										<p>The blockchain is distributed because there is no central database: it runs on millions of computers simultaneously, making the data public and accessible by anyone at any time. Each of these computers is referred to as ‘node’. It is also public, in that it is not managed by a single, central institution – it exists on multiple computers on the network.</p>
										<p>The way this innovative technology works is fairly simple: digital information is stored on unique ‘blocks’ of data that are then validated by the P2P network and stored on a public database (the ‘chain’). Each block stores information about the transaction and who is involved in it, and it is linked to the previous block in an unalterable way. Each block is valid only when referring to a previous one, it is permanently time-stamped and it is given an identifying code (the ‘hash’). Once recorded, no one can alter its code. This, combined with encryption, makes data on the blockchain extremely safe. If a hacker wanted to access the data on a block, not only would they have to re-write the block itself, but also its whole history (the series of blocks it is linked to).</p>
										<p>Another way the blockchain protocol protects itself from hackers is the so-called ‘proof of work’ mechanism.  Before a computer is given the consent to be part of the network, and therefore to create new blocks, it needs to prove its ‘integrity’ by solving a computational problem. This process is costly and it involves a lot of energy, making it less appealing for hackers to get involved with.</p>
										<p>Lastly, and perhaps more importantly, transactions on the blockchain are free. Anyone with or without an internet connection (simple transactions can be carried out also via mobile network) can be actively participating in the protocol. Because each transaction on the network is approved by other members of the blockchain, there is no need for intermediary companies such as commercial banks, online payment platforms or credit card companies to clear every transaction and charge the users their fees. The blockchain technology could potentially be a safer, free alternative to traditional money transfer and online payment services.</p>
										<p>Although this new “Internet of Value” has mainly been used for monetary transactions and as a platform for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, its characteristics (distributed network, no need for third-party verification, perfect balance between security and transparency) make it the perfect tool for the exchange of anything of value, from sensitive personal data to public government information. </p>
										<p>The blockchain could also get rid of intermediaries in transactions in which they are not essential.  In a not-too-remote future, we could improve crowdfunding by creating crowd-sourced funds that people have direct control on (no third party involved), or start offering new shared services (shared rides, shared houses) for which the transaction happens directly in between users (and not through companies like Uber or Airbnb).</p>
										<h3>What is the Potential Impact of this Development?</h3>
										<p>The blockchain protocol is free, extremely safe and transparent. It is based on cooperation between peers, and volunteers (the so-called ‘miners’) are rewarded for their contributions. It is inclusive, as everyone can be actively part of it, and public, in that it is not owned by anyone and it exists on the distributed network. </p>
										<p>This technology has the potential of completely cutting out transaction costs, and therefore, getting rid of the third-party companies that we currently depend on to verify our identity and avoid double-spending (that happens when the same unit of digital currency is spent in two places). On the blockchain, each transaction is unique and connected to the previous block and needs to be approved by the network before taking place. This process is significantly faster than the usual bank settlement times.</p>
										<p>This could help in many instances. We would be able to speed up international remittances and cut down the costs involved in the transaction (sometimes as high as 7%). We could revolutionise foreign aid and crowdfunding by delivering the money directly to the country or group of people in need. The transparency of each transaction would prevent corruption and ensure that every donation serves its purpose.</p>
										<p>Another major impact of the blockchain protocol could be how we manage our data online. The era of the internet brought, alongside its many benefits, several privacy-related issues. We depend on big companies for many essential services, that we get for ‘free’ in exchange for our personal information. Data is a very valuable asset and we have currently little to no control over how our own is being used. </p>
										<p>The blockchain technology could give every single user full control over its own personal information again. By enabling users to carry out direct P2P transactions, and not relying on intermediary companies for most services, there would be no need to give apps and banks access to our personal data anymore. Every single user would be able to decide what to share about themselves, and if and how would they want to monetize their own information.</p>
										<h3>How Will this Affect People?</h3>
										<p>The blockchain technology will allow people to be directly involved in the financial system. Everyone with an internet or mobile connection is allowed in, which means that everyone could virtually have equal opportunities in this new financial ecosystem. This would be of great significance in a world in which wealth is so unfairly and unequally distributed and could result in more social mobility and a more motivated and enterprising working class. Being in control of every single transaction, whether it be of money or any other valuable good, will make us finally be completely independent and responsible for our own financial situation.</p>
										<p>Imagining a world without intermediary companies, banks, apps can be very tough. Empty, almost. We are so used to not being directly involved and just benefit of the many services we have access to in exchange for our personal data, that we often forget that that is the price we pay for it. In a blockchain world, we would finally understand how valuable our personal information is and decide if to share it or not – and when we do, we would be able to monetise it at our own conditions. </p>
										<p>We would be able to create our own digital persona, a sort of transactional avatar that will not have to match our identity details as long as it will comply with the principles of the trust protocol. Not only will our online identity be not exposed anymore, but it will also be completely under our control. This would only be possible because on the blockchain our personal information will not be necessary to verify our identity details anymore.</p>
										<p>Blockchain, as any other innovative technology, could revolutionise many aspects of our life, but it comes with some risks. Freeing us from the third-party transactional control will lift a burden off our shoulders, but with excessive freedom usually comes the need for more restrictions. It comes without saying, that to exploit the full potential of the blockchain, we will need to make sure it is properly regulated and it will be used for the right purposes.</p>
