										<h2 id="content">What is Machine Learning?</h2>
										<p><i>“[Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” - Arthur Samuel, 1959</i></p>
										<p>Machine Learning (ML) is a field of Information Technology which ever-growingly dominates the industry. Defined by the process of transforming data 
										into something a machine can understand to then, using advanced mathematics and a variety of methods, find patterns in that data. The applications which 
										find these patterns can then apply the patterns to any data which is presented. The ML field envelops such a large variety of programs, applications and 
										uses, with one of the most prominent new subfields being Deep Learning (DL). Some of the most well-known and biggest DL technologies used today include 
										Facebook’s PyTorch and Google’s TensorFlow, which provide their libraries to individuals, companies and other groups to build upon and develop DL applications. </p>
										<p>Deep Learning utilises an abundance of artificial neural networks inspired by neurons in the human brain to greatly enhance the complexity, feasibility 
										and ability of Machine Learning. Neural networks form the core of modern ML. In a DL algorithm, there exist multiple layers of ‘neurons’, all with a ‘bias’ 
										to them and ‘weights’ between them. The weights connecting neurons or inputs define what pattern the next neuron is picking up on, and the bias defines 
										how much weighting is needed before the neuron becomes meaningfully active. Different input data will affect the proceeding neurons depending on the weighting 
										of their connection & their bias, repeated through multiple layers, to eventually provide an output which has received the highest weighting. The neural 
										network learns by then modifying the weights and biases of the neurons in the event of creating a neural network that will turn the input into the expected 
										or correct output. These values are modified not necessarily by random, however, by creating a cost function using gradient descent to calculate in which 
										direction these values should change, and by how much they should change. </p>
										<p>Machine Learning has become so popular and widespread today thanks to the mass amounts of data being provided by people on a daily basis in our modern 
										society. It’s good for processes with a long list of rules, continually changing environments, and at analysing large collections of data. Recommendation 
										systems like on YouTube, Netflix or Spotify learn patterns in the users’ watching or listening history. Anti-virus systems like Deep Instinct use ML to 
										pick up on patterns in malware code. Marketing systems like on online stores such as Amazon or Google take advantage of these patterns in data to custom-suit 
										advertisements to users. Fraud Detection systems like those in PayPal attempt to pick up on whether or not a transaction is legitimate. In 2019, 67% of 
										consumers online spoke to a chatbot taught by machine learning, with an estimated 85% for this year. NLP (Natural Language Processing) is utilising ML to 
										improve systems from Google Translate, to voice assistants like Alexa or Siri. Controversial autonomous vehicles like self-driving cars utilise this to learn 
										and improve upon their driving.</p>
										<p>There are so many places that Machine Learning can go in the future, able to be utilised for anything where traditional programming is too exhaustive to 
										create these machines. In the next few years, level 4 autonomous vehicles could begin to hit the road. Attention Mechanism, a method in machine learning to 
										only utilise specific, relevant parts of the neural network, will most likely become mainstream in all ML applications and will push Natural Language Processing 
										to its limits. The standard for diagnosis with doctors could be ML applications for diagnosis and treatment planning, with increased research and development 
										into medical uses for ML, using technologies from chatbots, to facial recognition software to convoluted neural networks diagnosing skin cancer. Progress into 
										Artificial Intelligence (AI) has skyrocketed due to ML, DL, neural networks and all the other technologies related to it, and ML is integral to the future development
										of AI. Advances in Quantum Computing will greatly improve upon the speeds of ML applications, further developing the software. More developments into hardware
										and software for ML from companies like Nvidia will also help to increase the efficiency of ML, and bring availability for it to end-users as well. </p>
										<h2 id="content">The Impact of Machine Learning</h2>
										<p>Machine Learning and its impact can be as daunting as it is exciting and revolutionary. ML will eventually make any complex technology using traditional programming 
										almost redundant due to its insane ability to act more efficiently, dynamically and reliably. Progress into ML is advancing at a rapid rate, and some are speculating 
										it will be akin to the industrial revolution, an AI revolution. ML impacts almost everyone, from the individual user, to companies, businesses, and governments. 
										Individuals will find themselves on the receiving end of the benefits and hindrances of ML applications developed by others. From riding in a self-driving car to perfect 
										voice-assistants, being advertised and recommended the exact product you were thinking of or having perfect driving routes on maps, tasks with heavy analytical elements 
										will be made simpler by ML. For businesses, ML systems will allow analysis and solutions to improve upon their business practices, finances and customer habits. Governments 
										will find themselves with mass amounts of data that ML can use to help with cybersecurity, internal security, economic stability, and even basic administrative tasks, 
										improving efficiency. With increased advancements come a huge shift away from human jobs, such as those in dangerous fields like bomb defusal, military positions and hazardous
										clean-up. There will also be a shift away from analytical and administrative jobs, with ML systems providing an easy and efficient way to perform repetitive and data heavy 
										jobs. Human jobs would most likely move more towards research and development, as well as engineering to create these ML systems. ML systems could be potentially destructive
										to society as a whole, from removing an abundance of jobs to the dystopian possibility full artificial intelligence ‘revolting’ against humans. ML systems can also however, 
										provide tools for people to flourish, making lives and tasks easier.</p>
										<h2 id="content">Machine Learning's Impact on a Personal Level</h2>
										<p>The daily life of all people will be and have been affected by the development of Machine Learning. A digital personal assistant can order you food when your pantry is 
										empty, AI bots in video games could act as personal trainers, a self-driving car takes you to your job while you read a personalised news and social media feed on your smart device.</p>
										<p>For myself personally, while I currently work in a computer parts wholesaler, I wish to become a lead software developer, working in the fields of mental health, education, 
										access to justice and death & ageing. Machine Learning would free up a lot of time for myself in my current job, not having to manually move and input data all the time in 
										managing warranty requests or updating the company website. I could spend more time on things like putting together computer systems, organising the warehouse and storefront, 
										improving the company’s website and more. Servicing jobs could be made so much easier, with technician issues diagnosed by a ML system and possible repair options being listed 
										in a shorter amount of time than I could ever diagnose a PC, increasing the amount and breadth of items and faults I could remedy. In my ideal job, the analysis side of ML 
										systems would help me greatly, providing in-depth insight into the patterns and data behind the concerned fields. </p>
										<p>For those around me, family and friends, the impact may be different. The majority of my friends are endeavouring into fields such as engineering, medicine and information 
										technology. ML should hopefully improve those fields, creating great developments for them. My family however, tend to be working in more administrative & analytical jobs. 
										They may have a hard time when ML systems can perform the majority of their job a lot better than they can. </p>
										<p>Machine Learning is a field which will most likely bring a great improvement to human life in the future. However, with no way to see what will happen in-between and how
										we as a society will handle the changes, there may be a large portion of people who might find themselves stuck outside of large changes and benefits it provides.</p>
