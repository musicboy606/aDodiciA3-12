										<h1>Exploring Autonomous Vehicle Technologies</h1>

										<h3 id="content">What does it do?</h3>
										<p>An autonomous vehicle (AV) is one that is capable of moving to a pre-determined destination without human input at all, for the purpose of  transporting the vehicle, passengers or cargo. There are six levels to determine how autonomous a vehicle is; ranging from requiring 'mostly human input' to 'no human input required at all'(DV – driverless vehicle).

											For a vehicle to perform autonomously, it must gather information about its positioning and information about its surroundings. A combination of sensors, generate information for the vehicle to process. Some of the sensors that autonomous vehicles use, include cameras, radar, lidar, sonar, GPS, odometry, inertia meter sensors and more. The autonomous vehicle then processes this information, to map out the vehicle within its surroundings. The vehicle requires a set of advanced machine learning (AI) systems and algorithms to do this. Once this information is processed, it can safely manoeuvre to the pre-determined destination.

										<h3>How Would it Improve Life?</h3>
										<p>Through the development of autonomous vehicles, the aim is to increase our quality of life. In theory, by removing the human element in driving it has the capability to reduce traffic congestion, prevent fatalities and decrease fuel consumption.
											Human errors contribute to thousands of preventable deaths each year, and autonomous vehicles have the potential to reduce this statistic.</p>

											<h3>What's Happening Within the Industry</h3>
											<p>Currently, there are numerous vehicle industries that either have or are in the process of developing and testing autonomous vehicles, from autonomous planes, helicopters, boats, cars, trucks and more. Multiple companies have invested in the development of autonomous vehicles such as Boeing, Airbus, Google (Waymo), Uber (Volvo), Nvidia, Tesla and much more.</p>
											<p>
												Although most of the autonomous vehicle industry seems to be progressing in regards to autonomous vehicle development, the automotive autonomous vehicle industry seems to have had multiple setbacks in regards to the technology and ethical and moral issues surrounding autonomous vehicles on public roads.
												<p>As the technology is still imperfect, and manufacturers are testing their autonomous vehicles on public roads, there are multiple public safety implications in regards to the use of this technology. Ever since the first autonomous vehicle accident, (uber) which hit and killed a pedestrian that was pushing a bike, there have been growing concerns about the safety of the use of this technology.</p>
												<p>In recent years, Tesla has mostly been under the spotlight from the National Transport Safety Board (NTSB) officials in America, regarding its autonomous vehicle accidents as there have been multiple deaths of drivers whilst using Tesla's 'Autopilot' feature. A majority of these drivers who were using the 'Autopilot' feature, treated the vehicle as fully autonomous, which does not require the driver to pay attention whilst the vehicle is in control.</p>
												<p>In an increased attempt to improve safety whilst using the Autopilot feature, Tesla has implemented a feature to address the issue of drivers’ lack of attention. The feature that Tesla implemented, 'nag', requires the driver to have both hands on the steering wheel at all times whilst using this Autopilot feature. If the sensors do not detect the driver's hands on the steering wheel, it will 'nag' the driver until the driver complies. Although in Germany, they have banned Tesla from using the term 'AutoPilot', As it was considered to mislead their consumers to believe the vehicle was capable of fully autonomous driving, Tesla has since renamed this feature to 'AutoDrive' in Germany.  Tesla however, plans to roll out firmware to enable 'Full Self-Driving' capabilities. CEO Elon Musk announced that their firm would be rolling out firmware beta tests that will be available to select consumers on the 20th of October 2020.</p>

												<p>There are also growing concerns in regards to how an autonomous vehicle will make ethical judgements and whether those judgements would be considered to be moral, in regards to whom the vehicle may choose to protect in a dangerous situation. According to Nature(.com), "when a driver slams on the brakes to avoid hitting a pedestrian crossing the road illegally, they are making a moral decision that shifts the risk from the pedestrian to the people in the car." At some point, autonomous vehicles will be required to make ethical decisions. However, these ethical decisions may not be globally accepted, as according to Nature(.com) moral choices are not considered to be universal.</p>
												<p>In Australia, currently, the laws on autonomous vehicles nationwide do not fully support their use on our public roads within Australia. Some states and territories have already passed laws for their use within specific States, however, the NTC (National Transport Commission) is working with the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) to roll out nationwide legislation (2020) to adapt our current laws to allow the use of innovative transport technologies throughout Australia. The Nationwide legislation will work towards building a road map for the safe deployment of autonomous vehicles within Australia.</p>

													<h3>What is the Likely Impact?</h3>
													<p> As various autonomous vehicle industry technologies become more prevalent in Australia today, it will more than likely re-shape Australia as we know it.</p>
													<p>As the laws and regulations for the use of autonomous vehicles progressively change and become more relatively accepted, we will more than likely see changes to our public transportation sector first.</p>
													<p>Last year in 2019, NSW was the first state to upgrade part of their railway network for public transport with the use of autonomous trains. Perhaps other states will follow within Australia within the next few years.</p>
													<p>Also in the Aviation sector, Boeing has just recently contracted the QLD government into the manufacturing of autonomous military aircraft within Australia.</p>
													<p>In terms of autonomous vehicles on public roads, the Australian government has already provided grants for trials throughout Australia for the use of autonomous technologies on public roads, some of which include autonomous buses and cars.</p>
													<p>We will however, more than likely see some form of an autonomous vehicle on our public roads within Australia, although, it will less likely be 'fully' autonomous. Experts say that the technology requirements for fully autonomous vehicles is decades away. Australia's laws will still require a driver behind the steering wheel whilst using autonomous vehicle technologies.</p>
													<p>Autonomous vehicles will also more than likely create jobs for different industries such as the Automotive OEMs/Suppliers, mobile services and technology sectors. It will also heavily affect the road infrastructure industry as well, as we will have to redesign our roads to suit autonomous vehicles, as our roads are currently designed with human drivers in mind.</p>

													<h3>How Will this Affect You?</h3>
													<p>I believe as a consumer, when forms of autonomous vehicles are introduced in the future, manufacturers, when selling their vehicles, will be required to state what level of autonomy their vehicle is capable of so as not to mislead consumers of the vehicle's capabilities. Possibly even a governing body may have to streamline names for features of autonomous vehicles, so that it is conveyed in a clearer matter to the user. Also, I believe at first, autonomous vehicles will be considered to be a luxury premium service, until the cost of manufacturing these vehicles becomes affordable for the everyday person. </p>
													<p>I also believe that at some point in the future, when autonomous vehicles become a majority of the market, non-autonomous vehicles will come into question and whether there is a place for them to co-exist in an autonomous society.</p>
													<p>As someone who is working towards a career in Information Technology, my future in the industry will probably be affected in a positive way by the autonomous vehicles industry. The autonomous vehicles industry will likely create brand new opportunities and career pathways to explore. I will therefore need to consider broadening my skillset through my studies at RMIT to include future Autonomous Vehicles Technologies. </p>
													<p>In the future… possibly the next train, car or bus I travel on could well be equipped with greater levels of autonomous vehicle technologies.</p>
