												<h3>About Me</h3>
												<p>Greetings! I was born in NSW Australia, and am currently living in Sydney. My cultural background is Greek on my mother’s side 
												and Croatian on my father’s side. I graduated High School in 2016 and have been working in a computer sales, installation and repair 
												store since. Some of my hobbies include playing the guitar, playing video games, cooking & baking, and playing around with video editing & graphic design.</p>

												<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
													<h3>Interests In IT</h3>
													<p>I have been extremely interested in the hardware and software aspects of IT since I was young, from how computers and software run to 
													how it can make my life easier. My father was the one to introduce me to, and teach me about all thing IT, and I experimented and played 
													around with all the technologies I could get my hands on throughout my life. I love to learn about the latest and greatest IT inventions, 
													with a lot of my main IT interests being game design, software development, machine learning and computer graphics.</p>
												</div>
											<div>
												<h3>Ideal Job In IT</h3>
												<p>Currently, my ideal job is as a Lead Software Developer, requiring management and execution of large development projects, technical work, 
												mentorship and management of team members. I love the design, development and programming aspects of IT work, and would especially love to work 
												on projects that help people. Portable Pty Ltd is a company which I would consider working for as they strive to create a positive impact on 
												people in the areas of mental health, education, access to justice and death & ageing in collaboration with organisations like Headspace.</p>

													<h3>Personality Profile</h3>
													 <span class="image main"><img src="images/adamMBT.png" alt="Myers-Briggs Test" style="float:center;"></span>
													 <span class="image main"><img src="images/adamLST.png" alt="Learning Style Test" style="float:center;"></span>
													 <span class="image main"><img src="images/adamCT.png" alt="Career Test" style="float:center;"></span>
													
													 <h3>Test results</h3>
													 <p>The results of my tests have confirmed to me that I work well in conflict resolution and mentorship which will help with being a Lead 
													 Software Developer, however, I may struggle with leadership slightly. My learning style test tells me I am a multimodal learner, with the 
													 exception of text, so I would be able to mentor to a wide range of individuals & my career test confirms my love for problem-solving, 
													 creativity and that I like to work with people. The career test also highlights my weakness in conventional and business fields.</p>
													 <p>While working in a team, I should be able to resolve any conflicts as a mediator that come between individuals, and hopefull I would be
													 a good mentor to any team members that need assistance and work with my team on an equal footing. From my learning styles result, I should be
													 very flexible in my ability to learn from and teach others unless it is via reading/writing. Lastly, from my career test, I should be able to 
													 fill in for individuals who have weaker investigative and social ability, and work with those who can cover for my lack of business and 
													 conventional skill.</p>
