										<h3 id="content">How was working in a group for us?</h3>
										<p>As a group, the general perception is that we are all very happy with each other and with what we have achieved for A2.</p>
										<p>We all started off with low expectations: some of us feared that other team members would not be committed enough, some thought it would be difficult to communicate and cooperate with complete strangers over the internet, and certainly all of us were shy and did not really know where to start from once that initial uneasiness would wear off. Most of us are new to this kind of group assessments and did not know what to expect.</p>
										<p>However, it was clear from the very first team meeting that there was no reason to worry about any of that. Our team was very efficient in distributing the work, setting deadlines and, perhaps most importantly, sharing and discussing possible project ideas. All of us were very honest about our strengths and weaknesses, and we divided our workload accordingly. This kind of transparency has been incredibly important, as it ultimately made each one of us feel good and confident about each individual contribution.</p>
										<p>When a member of our team left halfway through the assessment period, we had no problems redistributing tasks and quickly reorganising our shared platforms, deadlines and projects. Everyone was happy to take on some extra tasks and we managed to work past it as a team thanks to each member’s flexibility. This is also a good example of how our group was able to swiftly move past small issues to keep working towards the assignment’s completion.</p>
										<p>Most of us felt that there is room for improvement in our communication skills. Although we all worked very well together when online at the same time, unfortunately that did not happen very often. More immediate communication could have helped us be more efficient and would have allowed us to make last-minute changes when needed. Having said that, we all agree that this has improved as time went on, and we are confident that it will not be an issue anymore moving forward. </p>
										<p>We are very confident with the product of our work, and we are glad we got to this as a team. Our different backgrounds, skills and personalities put together resulted in something that we would not have been able to come up with individually. And is this not the whole point of working in a team? This was a learning experience for all of us, and we are looking forward to working together again for A3.</p>

										<h3>Individual Group Reflections</h3>
										<p></p>
										<h4>Jacopo</h4>
										<p>When I started this group project, I had very low expectations. I thought that people would not be committed enough, that I would have to chase them to get things done and compensate with extra work on me. The truth is that I was pleasantly surprised. Group aDodici cooperated very efficiently from the very beginning. We were able to distribute the work without any issue, identify our team ‘roles’ and get everything done with no delays. All my team members were very honest about their strengths and weaknesses, and that helped us understand how to contribute to this project at our best. </p>
										<p>Our team had to face a small problem. We started as a group of six, but one member disappeared after the second week and he did not bother to let us know that he dropped out of the course. This was a good test for us, and I was glad to see that we had absolutely no problems reorganising our tasks and responsibilities. This taught me how open-mindedness, flexibility and problem solving are fundamental skills to have when working in a team.</p>
										<p>One thing that we could improve moving forward is communication. Although all of us were very responsive once received the information, we sometimes took a bit too long to get back to each other and ended up not being able to make necessary changes to the weekly plan. Faster communication could lead to better flexibility and therefore more productivity.</p>
										<p></p>
										<h4>Nicholas</h4>
										<p>At first, I thought that establishing a group within this IT course could be quite difficult as it was required to happen before the census date. This meant that you could not be 100% certain about whether a group member might pull out of the course, so I aimed to seek group members who were actively participating within the weekly modules. </p>
										<p>In the first week, I felt that my communication skills were lacking, as I was quite nervous about actively participating in the video meetings. The more meetings we have had however, my communication skills have gradually improved. I still definitely need to work on conveying information clearly to other group members. </p>
										<p>As a group we did however, run into the issue of a group member leaving the course. I volunteered to take on some of the tasks that he was responsible for, such as establishing the GitHub repository website and creating an Industry report on the technology. Unfortunately, I had about half a week less than everyone else to complete the tasks. I then realised I had taken on too much responsibility, so I brought it up within the group in the following meeting. Jacopo happily took on the description responsibility for the group project.</p>
										<p>Overall, I do believe there is room for improvement in our communication skills, but we are definitely on the right path. </p>

										<h4>Adam</h4>
										<p>Last semester, I was in this course and had to withdraw due to my own personal issues, so I abandoned my group a week and a half into the assessment 2 task.
										This semester while trying again, I felt uneasy, unmotivated, unconfident, nervous that I wouldn’t perform well enough and that I might be the member of the group
										that brings everyone else down. Due to this train of thought, I did eventually fall behind on some of my tasks. My team members however, always felt positive, welcoming
										and honest which improved upon my own motivation and pushed me to kick back into gear and work hard to contribute to the assignment. The members of my team performed
										outstandingly, picking up extra tasks when our 6th member unfortunately had to withdraw from the course.</p>
										<p>Over the course of the next group assessment, I wish to extend my level of contribution and be more present in group meetings. I can improve on my portion of work done,
										the time in which I complete my tasks and overall group commitment. I have a good level of knowledge and experience in IT and I wish to utilise it to its fullest in the future.</p>
										<h4>Jeremy</h4>
										<p>When I heard that we had to do group projects quite early in the course I was very nervous. I was especially alarmed because the course is online, and I couldn’t gauge and get to know people in the course before making a group. After the first lecture I was pleasantly surprised to find that I had a group quick and easy.
											It was very encouraging to see how helpful everyone in the course was. I thought that we would maybe get some people who weren’t as active and committed and everyone has been great. I really appreciate that our group is very flexible, understanding, responsible, and honest.</p>
										<p>One thing I think I could improve on moving forward is being proactive and really being responsive. I appreciate the amount of work my group has done and I want to be a valued member. I also guess I want to feel less afraid of sounding stupid. I really am out of my comfort zone getting serious about IT. So, in the next few assignments I want to be able to take on more and give it my all. </p>
										<h4>Hamilton</h4>
										<p>As a part of this assignment we were asked to create groups and work towards the completion of the assignment, all in all I think this went well once the awkwardness of 5 introverts wore off. I think our shared commitment and organisation towards the completion of this assignment was probably our strongest attribute, I didn't once have concerns over whether or not we will get the assignment done on time.</p>
										<p>One way the team could have improved in my opinion is the group meetings, it wasn't very often we had every member online during scheduled meetings, this could have been because of work, personal related commitments or at least in my case, bieng hung over on a Sunday, some reasons better than others. This was not a big problem however because the meetings were recorded and watchable once they were done or we would reschedule so this did not have an impact on team performance. </p>
										<p>What surprised me though is how well the team moved on and moved past any small issues we had and how quick people were to take on parts of the assignment to make sure the ball kept on rolling. I guess that taught me a bit more about the importance of teamwork and how selflessness and team orientated thinking can generate results efficiently.</p>
